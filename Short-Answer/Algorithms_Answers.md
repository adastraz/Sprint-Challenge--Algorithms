#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) after testing, runtime of O(n)


b) for loop will run n times making O(n) while loop runs through half (n/2) becasue j*=2 so O(n log(n))


c) this is an O(1), only one argument can be passed in, only one check is run

## Exercise II
A binary search tree looks like the best method to me. begin at middle floor, if egg breaks, go to a shorter floor, if it doesn't break go to a higher floor. repeat until 'f' is found

runtime O(log(n))
